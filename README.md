# puzzle-shadow

This is not my submitted solution (I included only the `Prover.toml` as my [solution](https://gist.github.com/eightfilms/9ff8f540bf44f79f70000117ad54daf2)), but this repo includes fixes suggested in my [writeup](https://gist.github.com/eightfilms/eb544879e47d3b678cbaf766bf94186e). Please take a look at those links for my solution and writeup submissions respectively.


Running `nargo execute` on the repo as of latest commit fails, but that is expected because the fixes are supposed to fix the constraints in the original puzzle.
